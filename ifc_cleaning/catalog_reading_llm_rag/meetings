1. Different MVP dilivery
GM and SH differ in MVP delivery. 
Bauteil matcher is a core tool for SH which we are developing.
There exists discrepency between SH and GM in developing Bauteil matcher. We will need to discuss our actual deliver by the end of the year if GM involvment in the development of bauteil matcher changes. 
2. Different Data format
The two carpentry currently have different ways of calculating the layer "Zellulosefaserdämmung	", which leads to uncertainty in calcuation as
    2.0.1 More varaitions could arise if this layer are seens as "product group"  => meaning the 250,000 combinations we have will still increase 
    2.0.2 If the behaviour of the data from these possible new combinations coming from the "Zellulosefaserdämmung" are different from the current layers, it affects how we could capture the behaviour of the entire data landscape. To optimise them, we can not optimise it without at least being confident to say we have seen enough and can draw conclusion.
    2.0.3 The actual matching/ connection to the DB is done by Qhifang, without consolidating the data format we can not create a DB => A decision has to be made not now since we can still analsye the data and then optimize it without saving to a DB and relating it to other entities but at some point to develop into a tool for SH, this will need to be discussed.
3. Minimal Packaging of the Matcher
If we are to develop a matcher as a minimum working tool for SH, we would need to spend a bit of our own efforts to create a minimal front end, backend and DB which were supposed to be done by Qhifang but if he has other prioties, we need some help.
4. Calculation of U values, acoustics, structures etc....
The current rules we have are not proved by experts, We will need to have someone who can tell us how to calculate them and the certification process etc... 

In short, what we need 
1. Actual data landscape 
    What could still be resulting in variants ?
    Do we need to also look at other products apart from aussenwand, does their data behave the same way as the Aussenwand etc?
2. Consolidation between GM and SH
    Either Consolidation of decision of the data format. This is something GM and SH has to decide regardless of matching
3. Experts opinions on performance value caluation
4. All Searching Criteria 
    Conditions such as minimizing the number of mateirals, is_certiried, zu_value search by range or target ?  etc.... Would be great if we have a list of this but at current stage it does not affect the data discovery process.

What are the differences between the two MVP ?? 
full Matching criteria that should also matches the data schema aka, search price by range, by what attribute booleans
You mentioned more variants, what are the variants you are thinking of? How many ? 
The question lies not now not in calculating all of them but set up rules to calculate them
and also get a sense of how many variants are there, if they fall into a pattern or not
Certain questions are not answerable, we need expert
Rules => criteria/ data schema => dtermined if we can answer it or not => if not, we need to ask expert

Getting a sense of the data, and seeing if we need to
1. save all of the data
2. precalculate all of the variants/ half of them 
3. If they follow certain pattern, we can use the pattern to approximate, or use it to inform the search criteria
e.g, U values do not exist at 0.17-0.18, then searching has no point at this range and since they cluster together,
we can determine a step kind of search ? or determine whether to go to certain U value, you must take certain layetrs
so if you search say 0,2, you must take a construction layer of 340mm up something like this

This is a step for data analysis, not really for the matching so why save at DB ? 
also saving at DB is done by QiFang anyways

What needs to be done by the end of the year ? what is the must have for the bauteil matcher ? 


Tenanat have different views on the data 
Current process
1. Global katalog 
2. Open Project, creating a project automaitcally creates a project catalog
3. Create anforderungen so a subset of the global katalog that fulfills the condiitons is created
4. They mentioned certain layers are created (implying a new build up is created and will need to be pushed to the DB ?)
5. 


I think the word optimization is used on two levels
one for finding the closest fit based on users 
one for optimizting the data => calculating all the vairants is it necessay => how much do we need to claculate ? part pre-calculated, part saving 

what is a priduct group ? the layres you see in ecvel are more like a product group

Search on product level 

requirement set group = a list of different requirement e.g, FR, thickness ..... 

How many levels i have => in case of2, with insulation, minarl, stone wall => means 3 variants => 6 different stadnard product => 
calculate non standard 



02.07
Product group => specified certain layer
the system should working on both materials and products product groups = materials 
mathcing happens on the product group level 

filtering critreia will help reduce some combinations 
wall build up
level of information from product
pre-filter => 2 filters 
post-filter 
matching
filtering for product group 
what are the thickness standards 

db for perfromance will refer to the guid to your different products 

the core dispute now is you can just use the stabdard
genertor => all variations =>
you know the stadnard but would you like to know other possiblities.
the clients specfies certain things that doesnt fit the standard 
a scalable option for also other firms 
to understand whether it is calculatable whether it is 
combination happens to the lowest level 


track the version of the 3d object 
concactnate strings to original ifc guid
is it a layer or not ? 
matching catalog => write to project catalog^



preset => for the group =>
what layer coppresond to another layer 
some layers are fixed and others are not 
isnt it already wh
for every buldup => we need pre-dertmined sets of variants 

we need a bit of an Ui here 


calculating all the variants 

Pre-filtering
1. Type of the product
2. layers materials / thickness
3. whether certain build up is valid
